# SlidePilot: AI-Powered PowerPoint Editor

## Product Overview

SlidePilot is an AI-powered PowerPoint editor built with Tauri that leverages LibreOffice headless as its core presentation engine. The application enables users to create, edit, and enhance PowerPoint presentations through an intuitive AI agent interface.

## Core Vision

Create a seamless presentation editing experience where users can interact with an AI agent to perform complex PowerPoint operations through natural language commands, while maintaining full manual control over their presentations.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (Tauri webview)
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri backend)
- **Presentation Engine**: LibreOffice Headless
- **AI Integration**: LLM-powered agent with presentation editing tools
