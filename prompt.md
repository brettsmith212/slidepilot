You will be working on your own to complete all steps starting with step 5 in IMPLEMENTATION.md. It is very important that when you complete a step, you test it and make sure everything is compiling and running as expected. Be sure to also check the UI via the web interface that starts with `bun run tauri dev`. It is very important you run `bun run tauri dev` in the background, or you will get hung on it because it runs indefinitely. After each step is complete, you will mark it complete in IMPLEMENTATION.md, then commit all your changes to the main branch, then proceed to the next step. Do not stop until all steps complete.
